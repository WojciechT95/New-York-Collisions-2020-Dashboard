Taking into account the daily distribution of accidents. It should be noted that the highest number of accidents occur in the afternoon between 1 PM and 6 PM.
The main contributing factor to the accident was driver distraction.
The most common victims in accidents were drivers themselves, second were pedestrians, and third were cyclists. The number of injured and killed accident participants is also in the same order.
